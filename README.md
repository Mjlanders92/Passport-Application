# Passport-Application
Creating an API to store passport application information on a database and also delete applications from the database all via urls.
This is my very first project ever using Java! My requirements are as above and I need to use DropWizard framework to create the API.
I need to use Maven, Junit for testing, JSON for data transfer and I need to adhere for REST design.
I'm looking forward to working on this project! If anyone has any suggestions towards where to begin please feel free to comment!
